            We don’t just partner with any carrier. DB9 Logistics works exclusively with transport companies that are fully licensed, insured, and in full compliance with FMCSA regulations. Our vetting process is continuous — we regularly update our database, verify insurance and DOT status, and remove carriers that fail to meet our standards. Your safety and satisfaction depend on our diligence, and we take that responsibility seriously.
